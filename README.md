##Raison D'Etre
Learning me a Haskell for great good!  Writing up stupid algorithms in Haskell, to train my mind.

##Beadsort
Imagine rows of beads on an abacus, where the poles of the abacus are the columns.  Turn the abacus sideways.  All of the rows are intact, but they are in different places.  In fact, they are in sorted order!  This is O(n) irl, but pseudopolynomial for computers.
